## Author self-review

I've reviewed my PR for the following:
- [10 Oct 2020] Metadata in the frontmatter, including `pcx_content_type` and - for tutorials - `updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [Web Application] PCX content strategy overall.
- [The Acadiem Group 2020 NEW MarkBook HTML5 is Here!] PCX style guidelines (product names, capitalization, etc.).
- [http://tdsb.on.ca/ mrichardson@acadiemgroup.com ] Needed redirects (if deleting any existing pages).
- [Single Sign On (SSO)] Code blocks && other formatting issues (bolding, italics, lists).
